## 🔮 Project Overview

**Lineage of the Arcane** is a gameplay prototype exploring a unique magic system where spells are sentient entities. Players do not cast magic; they negotiate with ancient "Progenitors" (Parents) to lend their aid.

This Unity project implements a revolutionary magic system where power comes at a cost - your very life force.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics Implemented

### 1. The Tether System
Mana does not exist. Summoning drains the user's max health (Physical Tether) and sanity.
- **Health Drain**: Continuous cost while tethered
- **Risk/Reward**: High power = High drain rate
- **Tether Break**: When health is depleted, the bond snaps violently

### 2. Ancestral Temperament
Summons have specific personalities (Aggressive, Passive, Rhythm-based). Failing to adhere to their playstyle results in the summon damaging the player.
- **Ignis Mater**: Demands constant aggression
- **Punishment System**: Violate temperament = take damage

### 3. Environmental Shifts
Summoning a Parent changes the physics and lighting of the game map globally.
- Each Parent has unique visual effects
- World-altering presence
