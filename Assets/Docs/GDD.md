# Lineage of the Arcane - Game Design Document

## Overview

**Lineage of the Arcane** is a gameplay prototype exploring a unique magic system where spells are sentient entities. Players do not cast magic; they negotiate with ancient "Progenitors" (Parents) to lend their aid.

> "Magic is not a tool. It is a family tree. And you are the youngest child."

---

## Core Concept

In this game, magic is not a resource to be spent—it's a relationship to be maintained. Each magical entity (called a "Parent") has its own personality, demands, and risks. Summoning one creates a "Tether" that drains the player's life force.

---

## Core Mechanics

### 1. The Tether System

**Concept:** Mana does not exist. Summoning drains the user's max health (Physical Tether) and sanity.

**How It Works:**
- When a player summons a Parent, a Tether is formed
- The Tether continuously drains the player's current health
- Different Parents have different drain rates
- If health drops to zero while tethered, the Tether snaps

**Risk/Reward:**
- High-power Parents have higher drain rates
- Players must balance power gained vs. health lost
- Strategic timing of tethering is crucial

### 2. Ancestral Temperament

**Concept:** Summons have specific personalities (Aggressive, Passive, Rhythm-based). Failing to adhere to their playstyle results in the summon damaging the player.

**Personality Types:**
| Type | Requirement | Example Entity |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Aggressive | Must attack frequently | Ignis Mater |
| Passive | Must avoid combat | Aqua Pater |
| Rhythmic | Must follow patterns | Tempus Mater |
| Sacrificial | Must take damage | Dolor Mater |

**Punishment System:**
- Each Parent monitors player behavior
- Violating temperament triggers punishment
- Punishments include damage, debuffs, or instant tether break

### 3. Environmental Shifts

**Concept:** Summoning a Parent changes the physics and lighting of the game map globally.

**Examples:**
- **Ignis Mater:** Ambient light turns red, floor becomes hazardous
- **Aqua Pater:** World becomes flooded, movement slowed
- **Terra Mater:** Gravity increases, structures emerge

---

## Entity Hierarchy

### Tier 0: The Parents (Progenitors)
- Most powerful entities
- Highest tether cost
- Global environmental effects
- Complex temperament requirements

### Tier 1: The Scions
- Descendants of Parents
- Moderate tether cost
- Local environmental effects
- Simpler temperament requirements

### Tier 2: The Heirs
- Weakest magical entities
- Low tether cost
- Minimal environmental effects
- Forgiving temperament

---

## The Rampant State

When a Tether breaks unexpectedly (not manually severed), the Parent enters a **Rampant** state:

- The Parent is no longer bound to the player
- It may attack the player or act chaotically
- Environmental effects remain active
- Player must flee or find a way to rebind

---

## Planned Features

### Custody Battle (Multiplayer)
A competitive mode where two players attempt to tether the same Parent:
- Both players' health drains faster
- The Parent favors whoever better matches its temperament
- One player eventually "wins" the Parent
- Loser suffers backlash damage

### Evolution System
Players can strengthen bonds over time:
- Successful tethering increases affinity
- High affinity reduces tether cost
- Max affinity unlocks special abilities
- Parents may "remember" betrayals

    ↳ IgnisMater (Tier 0 - Parent)
    ↳ Scion (Abstract - Tier 1)
        ↳ EmberScion
    ↳ Heir (Abstract - Tier 2)
        ↳ CandlelightHeir
    ↳ (Future) AquaPater

    → References PlayerController

CustodyBattle
    → References MagicParent
    → References multiple PlayerControllers

PlayerController
    → Tracked by MagicParent instances

## UI Elements (Planned)

### Health Bar
- Standard red bar for current health
- Grey overlay showing "burned" max health from tethering

### Sanity Indicator
- Peripheral screen effects at low sanity
- Sound distortion effects

### Tether Indicator
- Visual line connecting player to summon
- Color indicates Parent's current temperament status

---

## Audio Design (Planned)

- Each Parent has a unique ambient sound
- Temperament violations trigger warning sounds
- Rampant state has intense audio cues
- Environmental shifts affect ambient soundscape

---

## Art Direction (Planned)

- Dark fantasy aesthetic
- Each Parent has a distinct visual identity
- Tether effects glow with Parent's color
- Environmental shifts are dramatic but readable

---
